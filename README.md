## Overview

This project is a demo application created with **Sails.js** for the sole purpose of learning and exploring the framework's features. Sails.js is a powerful MVC framework for Node.js, designed to simplify the development of data-driven applications.

Through the application i explored on core concepts such as setting up models, controllers, and routes. It allowed experimentation with real-time data updates and API integration. This project helped me deepen my understanding of the framework and its practical applications in web development.

<!--
Note:  Generators are usually run using the globally-installed `sails` CLI (command-line interface).  This CLI version is _environment-specific_ rather than app-specific, thus over time, as a project's dependencies are upgraded or the project is worked on by different developers on different computers using different versions of Node.js, the Sails dependency in its package.json file may differ from the globally-installed Sails CLI release it was originally generated with.  (Be sure to always check out the relevant [upgrading guides](https://sailsjs.com/upgrading) before upgrading the version of Sails used by your app.  If you're stuck, [get help here](https://sailsjs.com/support).)
